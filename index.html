                    <h2>Introduction to Website Development</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I'm Dev, a full-stack engineer, and welcome to Code to Concept!</p>
                    <p>You might be wondering, "Dev, what's a <b>full-stack engineer</b>?" I'll be explaining this later in the guide, so make sure to stick around.
                    So... why should you invest in learning how to build a website?<br>
                    To be honest, I can't give you a why, I can only give you the means, the how.<br> It is up to you to find out what you want to do with it.<br><br>
                    Maybe you're interested in:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learning a new skill</li>
                        <li>Career opportunities</li>
                        <li>The creative freedom it brings</li>

                    </ul>           
                    
                    <p>So, who am I to make a guide on how to build a website?<br><br>
                        At the time this project was published, I was in my third year of college, majoring in Software Development.
                        I've built many projects, one of them being a website for a local church. 
                        I had a passion for what I was doing, and I spent many hours each day at home learning, researching, 
                        and looking for resources to propel me forward. I'd like to take the knowledge I've learned and share it with people that, like me not long ago,
                        also want to build a website.

                        <h3>Coding vs No-Code Platforms</h3>
                        <p>There are two paths to creating websites. Coding, being a more traditional, manual approach 
                            which is what this guide will be focusing on. 
                            The other is using no-code platforms such as wix or squarespace, which allow you to build websites with minimal or no coding knowledge required.<br>
                            Let's dive into why you would choose one over the other.</p>

                        <h3>Problem Solvers</h3>
                        <p>Learning to code is a lot more than learning to write a program the machine can understand. 
                        It's about problem-solving, breaking large tasks into smaller, manageable parts.</p>
                        <p>All developers face the struggle of a problem that feels larger than they can handle, 
                        and many will spend countless time on a problem, looking at it from every angle, 
                        examining every possible universe and alternate timeline for the answer (a little exaggerated but you get the point).</p>
                        <p>
                        The thing is... websites aren't built perfectly in one go. Debugging and testing are part of the process. 
                        When you're coding, you'll write something, test it, break it, fix it, tweak it - this is normal. Embracing trial and error 
                        is the key to becoming a great developer.

                        <h3>Origins of debugging</h3>
                        <p>Earlier in the guide, we've mentioned debugging and testing, but what exactly do they mean?
                            The term "debugging" has its origins in early computing and engineering. it was popularized 
                            by a famous incident involving a computer scientist by the name of <b>Grace Hopper</b> in the 1940s. While working
                            on a Harvard Mark II computer, her team discovered a moth that had gotten trapped in one of the computer's relays, causing it to malfunction. 
                            the engineers removed the moth and Hopper recorded in her notebook:<br><br>
                            <i>"First actual case of bug being found."</i><br><br>
                            This event led to the term "debugging", the process of finding and fixing errors in a program. 
                            Testing is the process of finding issues before they become bugs.

                        <h3>Step-by-Step Process</h3>
                        <p>The fundamentals of building a website can be summarized in three parts:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>üß± HTML:</b> The content of the page. Think of this as the walls and roof of a house.</li>
                            <li><b>üé® CSS:</b> This is the styling of your page. Think of it as painting the walls.</li>
                            <li><b>‚öôÔ∏è JavaScript:</b> This is the functionality. Think of it as the doors and windows being able to open and close.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Below you'll find an example of how HTML code is usually set up.<br>
                           Everything in the head defines the website, while everything in the body is what will be displayed to the user. 
                        </p><br>
                        <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;My Website&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Welcome!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

                    <br><p><b>Fun Fact</b>: A website can be built using just HTML!</p>

                      clicking inspect. Feel free to try it now!<br> Make sure you zoom out all the way for the next step, or else it won't work.

                    this will make the website editable like a document, and you are able to click on any text on the page and edit
                  it directly. To get rid of changes, all you have to do is refresh the page.</p>
